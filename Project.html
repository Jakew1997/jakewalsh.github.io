<h1>My Project idea: Smart Mirror</h1>

<p>
    The project I have decided on is a “Smart Mirror” Which is basically an old tablet, or LCD screen which has a two way mirror over the top, put into a frame, and ran either through an app (for a tablet) or a Raspberry Pi for a monitor, which uses Linux to run the applications. The mirror will be customizable on what can be displayed, but the most common is a clock, calendar, weather, and reminders. You can add motion sensors to turn on when someone moves in front, microphone for voice command, and speakers to have a A.I like Siri or the Android equivalent to, to respond to you.  
</p>

<p>
    I have a huge interest in “Smart” objects, and how they can be implemented in daily use, we have our smart phones, but thought what else could be made? I had a look at Raspberry projects and the Smart Mirror is one of the top projects, and I found it really interesting how customizable it was, you can add whatever info you want to display and it’s at quite an affordable price. You can make one for about or even less than $150. But it was cool that instead of getting up and immediately going to your phone, you can get ready and get the info you need for the day while brushing your teeth, or putting on makeup etc. No need to distract yourself with a phone. 
</p>

<p>
  The Smart Mirror is a two-way mirror, but it has an electronic display at the back of the glass. It can function like a tablet, or a computer, depending if you’re using a monitor or not, which will dictate if you’ll download an app on a tablet, or use a Raspberry Pi running Linux. You can also choose the screen size, which can affect costs a bit. It can show a clock in the form of an analogue or digital clock, and you can edit the time zone for your location, the date along with any notifications or reminders for the day, weather with tips like “Take a jacket it’s chilly” or “It will rain take an umbrella”, news feed which could be local news, national news, or even your social media which you can scroll through if you make your mirror touch sensitive, a traffic report going to work, showing how long it will take, and can even pull up a map to look at. It is very easily customizable showing the relevant information you want just by editing what apps are loaded, and whatever user information you want to put in, there are heaps of people that contribute by creating widgets and apps for the mirror that others can download for themselves, and since it uses Linux, it’s so open that people can create their own apps depending on their wants or needs. And what's great is that you don’t need to open any apps. You load them in the background and then you just look at the screen and the information you want is right there. Some additional features you can add if you don’t mind the additional cost is making it a touch screen, so you can interact with it more and add more depth of what you can do with the mirror. Motion sensor, which will automatically turn it on when you walk in front of it so that you can have it set to sleep so as not to effect the electricity bill. You can add voice control, so you can ask questions for it to google, or give commands, like setting reminders, or even ordering an uber! You can even set it up with a webcam for facial recognition, allowing the mirror to identify who is looking at the mirror, and tailor what information is displayed by having set profiles for each individual. 
</p>

<p>
    To build this product, you will need a tablet or monitor, you can take your pick depending on the size you want and your budget. A Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi 3 recommended for the built in Wifi component), A frame or cabinet to hold the monitor, you can take measurements and buy one, or custom make your own, which you’ll just need some timber to cut to the desired size, a drill to put it together, and some electrical tape to make all the wires and chords safe.  A two-way mirror, you can use an Acrylic one, it’s cheaper but will come out a lot dimmer, so if you want to pay extra you can grab a glass one. And a mouse and keyboard which will be used to set up the Raspberry Pi. For the simplest way to set up the software, you can download the MagicMirror project made by Michael Teeuw, and then enter the proper line of code to set it up.  
</p>

<p>
    It is not hard to put this all together and could be considered a great beginner project. You need beginner skills using Linux, as you can run the MagicMirror project, so you aren’t coding this all itself. It is an open source project, so you can add your own modules if you have the programming skills. Which will require you to use JavaScript to give your module logic, some basic HTML for the layout, and CSS for styling. You can write your logic in nearly every language, you will still need a wrapper in JavaScript to integrate it.  
    Basic carpentry skills if you custom make your frame, and want to give it a specific design.  
</p>

<p>
    If you are successful putting this together, you’ll have a fully built mirror which can be hung wherever you want. You’ll have tailored the content on the raspberry pi to fit your interests, and they will allow for easier access to this information whilst multitasking other activities, or you may just be doing this as a passion project and the outcome leaves you feeling satisfied that you could build this, which could lead you to furthering your skills using Linux, or the coding languages to make your own personal modules to display.
